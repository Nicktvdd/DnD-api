# Dungeons and Dragons API for random character generation
## Description
This is an API to generate a random character for Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition. It's a hobby project for personal use.
I will expand on it gradually and add more features as I go along. If you'd like to see some features, feel free to suggest them!

## Usage
To randomly generate your own characters you will have to clone the repo and run it on your local machine with Intellij.
In the future I will host it on a server and make it available for everyone if possible.

## Examples
